# Adds a line to /home/sebastiano/.local/share/sdep/once. It is possible to specify a date, which will be
# read by date -d and prepended to the input text.
# -d is a non-portable option of GNU date. On some other systems one can
# accomplish the same with the -j option.

# Usage: sdep-add [date]
# Example: sdep-add "next monday"
